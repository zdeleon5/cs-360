# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The application was a weight rracker. It required three database entities (weight, goal, and user). It seeked to provide users with a simple and intuitive UI that allowed them to easily track their daily weight and set a weight goal.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screen I felt was the most important to implement was the data grid. The UI kept users in mind by making it simple to look at with buttons that were intuitively pplaced.  

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I chose to use a docs-first approach. I was consistently using the Android Dev docs to guide me. This will help me to familiarize myself with new technologies quicker.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I used the logging API implemented in Android SDK

# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had the hardest time implementing the goal weight update on the home screen. I had to format the date string so the home screen could retrieve the latest goal weight.

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The data grid. I felt that it was my most thorough implementation considering all factors.
